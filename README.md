## Overview

This repository contains a **NetLogo-based agent-based model (ABM)** that simulates the influence of social media on youth voter turnout and political polarization. The model includes multiple agent types—**youth voters, non-youth voters, media entities, and posts**—to study interactions and information spread in a virtual social environment.  

The project is developed by **Group 2 (CAVUM)**.
